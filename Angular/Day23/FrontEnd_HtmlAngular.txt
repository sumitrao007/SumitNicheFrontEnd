1 @Input()
	- to send data from parent to child 
	
	app.html
	<app-parent1></app-parent1>
	
	parent1.html
	
	<app-child1 [parentStrData]="strData" ></app-child1>
	
	parent1.ts 
	strData:string="....";
	
	child1.ts
	@Input() parentStrData:string=''
	
	child1.html
	<h2> {{parentStrData}}</h2>
	
	
	
2 @Output()
	- To send data from Child to parent 
	- U have to create a custom event 
	- For that we use EventEmitter class
	- child2 to parent2 
	
	child2.html
	<button (click)="onSend()">
	
	child2.ts 
	
	@Output() childStrEvent=new EventEmitter();
	strdata:string=''
	
	onSend(){
		this.childStrEvent.emit(this.strdata);
	}
	
	{{strDataReceived}}
	
	<child2 (childStrEvent)="strDataReceived=$event" >
	
	parent2.ts 
	strDataReceived:string='';
	
3 inbuild Pipe 
	- to transform ur data without changing its value 
	<h2> {{strdata | lowercase}}</h2>
	<h2> {{strdata | uppercase}}</h2>
	<h2> {{strdata | titlecase}}</h2>
	
	<h2> {{0.25 | percent}}</h2>
	<h2> {{0.025 | percent}}</h2>
	<h2> {{0.025 | percent:'1.1'}}</h2>

Today's Lecture Agenda
1 inbuild Pipe 
2 Custom Pipe 
	- PipeTransform => interface
	- transform(value:any,...args:any)
3 Http Services
	- It is used to connect ur front end to backend server 
	steps 
	1 To create a service => http service => its our custom service 
	2 To use http method for that we have to use HttpClientModule to import in app.module.ts file 
		http method 
			1 get => it is fetch a data from backend server 
			2 post => To send a data to your backend server from front end server 
			3 put => To update a particular record
			4 delete => To delete a particular record
	3 To access these http method we have to create dependancy injection in our custom service 
		HttpClient 
 HttpRequest & HttpResponse 
 https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
 - It is a dummy backend give by community 
 - It is a fake service 
 - bcz it is not store data into the database but it gives a response of ur request
